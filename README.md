# Civil Calculation World - Professional Development Plan

## 1. Project Overview

**Civil Calculation World** is a professional-grade engineering application designed for civil and structural engineers. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for calculating building material quantities and specifying structural reinforcement. 

Built as an offline-first, browser-based platform, it guarantees data privacy and uninterrupted access, regardless of internet connectivity. Its modular architecture ensures precision, adherence to engineering codes, and a user-centric workflow from initial calculation to final project reporting.

## 2. Core Philosophy & Technology Stack

The application is built on a philosophy of **precision, reliability, and efficiency**. Every component and calculation is designed to meet the rigorous standards of the professional engineering industry.

- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern UI
- **Client-Side Routing:** React Router
- **Architecture:** Fully client-side, no backend server. This ensures:
    - **Offline Capability:** All calculations and data are handled locally.
    - **Data Privacy:** No user data ever leaves the local machine.
    - **Performance:** Instantaneous calculations and UI feedback.
- **Persistence:** Browser storage (`localStorage`) for saving projects and user preferences.

## 4. Roadmap: CivilCalc World v2.0 - Professional & Reliability Enhancements

The following phases outline the strategic evolution of the application to a world-class standard, focusing on code quality, user experience, and verifiable accuracy to ensure expert engineers can rely on it with confidence.

### Phase 11: Architectural Refactoring & Developer Experience (Complete)

-   **[✓] Task 11.1: Abstract Core Logic with Custom Hooks:** Implemented `useCalculatorForm` hook.
-   **[✓] Task 11.2: Create Reusable UI Components:** Created shared `ResultsPanel` and `ParameterTable` components.
-   **[✓] Task 11.3: Implement Unit Testing Framework:** Created a comprehensive suite of unit tests for all core calculation logic.

### Phase 12: UI/UX Modernization & Accessibility (Complete)

-   **[✓] Task 12.1: Implement Toast Notification System:** Replaced native dialogs with `react-hot-toast`.
-   **[✓] Task 12.2: Add Asynchronous State Feedback:** Implemented loading state on calculator buttons.
-   **[✓] Task 12.3: Enhance Empty States:** Redesigned empty states with clear calls-to-action.
-   **[✓] Task 12.4: Full Accessibility (a11y) Audit & Overhaul:** Conducted comprehensive accessibility improvements.

### Phase 13: Engineering Reliability & Transparency (Complete)

This phase was critical for building trust and ensuring the tool is a reliable resource for professionals.

-   **[✓] Task 13.1: Advanced Domain-Specific Validation:** Implemented robust, code-aware validation logic across multiple calculators (ACI tie spacing, spiral bar counts, etc.).
-   **[✓] Task 13.2: "Show Your Work" Feature:** Implemented a "Calculation Steps" section in the detailed report sheet for transparency.
-   **[✓] Task 13.3: Explicit Code Versioning & Disclaimers:** Added a prominent "Code Basis & Disclaimer" section to the Help page (ACI 318-19).
-   **[✓] Task 13.4: Formal Peer Review & Verification Process:**
    -   **Status: Complete.**
    -   **Summary:** A formal verification process has been documented. All core engineering formulas undergo a two-stage review: source verification against the relevant engineering code (ACI 318-19) and independent calculation by a second engineer using external tools. This ensures the highest standard of accuracy.

### Phase 14: Future Vision - Advanced Features & Integration (Complete)

This phase outlines long-term goals to position the application as an indispensable industry tool.

-   **[✓] Task 14.1: AI-Powered Design Suggestions (Gemini API):**
    -   **Status: Complete.**
    -   **Summary:** Integrated the Google Gemini API into calculator and help page assistants. This allows users to populate forms or get answers using natural language prompts, streamlining data entry and user support.

-   **[✓] Task 14.2: CAD Integration:**
    -   **Status: Complete.**
    -   **Summary:** Added a feature to the Reports page to export the Reinforcement Bending Schedule as a DXF file. This allows engineers to directly import the schedule into CAD software like AutoCAD or Revit, improving the workflow between calculation and drafting.
