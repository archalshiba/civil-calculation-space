    "soilBearingPressure": "The allowable soil bearing pressure is a key geotechnical parameter obtained from a soil investigation report. It represents the maximum pressure the soil can safely support.",
    "soilFrictionAngle": "The internal friction angle (Ï) of soil is a measure of its shear strength. It is a critical parameter for calculating lateral earth pressure and retaining wall stability.",
    "surchargeLoad": "Uniform load on soil surface behind the wall.",
    "embedmentDepth": "Effective embedment depth (hef) is critical for anchor capacity. ACI 318-19, Chapter 17 provides requirements to prevent concrete breakout failure.",
    "edgeDistance": "Minimum concrete edge distance (ca1) is required to prevent side-face blowout and pryout failure for anchors loaded in shear, as specified in ACI 318-19, Chapter 17.",
